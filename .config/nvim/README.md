These nvim configs were inspired by [MartinLwx's nvim configuration](https://github.com/MartinLwx/dotfiles/tree/394a8cc9dc95c3cbbd0eff014943c7228a545f14/nvim).

Martin's work helped me set up a bunch of things, including (but not limited to):
- the `lazy` package manager
- the nvim LSP using mason and null-ls
- nvim-cmp
- some default options
- some plugins like leap and nvim-tree
